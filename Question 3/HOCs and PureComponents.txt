When to use higher order components (HOCs)?
Higher-order components composes one component into another by wrapping the original component in a container component, 
which is composition as opposed to inheritance. Thus, we use HOCs when we want to create a new component that reuses the
current componentâ€™s logic in a functional programming sense (pure function). 

When to use PureComponent?
PureComponent should be used only when re-rendering of components depends only on the props and state of the component,
and thus, every child component also needs to be a PureComponent. This is because shouldComponentUpdate() only does a shallow
comparison between objects and if prop changes are deep within nested objects, the rendering updates could be missed.
Using the PureComponent, however, does allow for performance improvements.
