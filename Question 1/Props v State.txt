Props are used to pass data from one component to another while state is a local data storage for a component and is managed internally. 
A component would thus pass data (or its state) to their child component through props, and if a prop needs to be changed, 
the state of the parent component should be changed instead.
Hence, props are immutable while state is mutable.
